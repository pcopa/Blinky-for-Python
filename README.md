# Blinky-for-Python
Loading Blinky for Python sample in VS2015 

After loading the solution file, I'm getting "error : Object reference not set to an instance of an object". 
And when trying to open the properties on the solution tab, I'm getting a slew of "An error occurred while loading the rule set file 'C:\Prog......" messages.
BTW Blinky for C# works fine.
Any sugestions?
